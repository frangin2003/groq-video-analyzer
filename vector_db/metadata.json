[{"description": " This is a still image from a car camera, showing an urban street scene with overlaid text and graphics. The photograph captures a clear day with blue skies and scattered clouds. In the foreground, there's a busy four-lane highway with several cars driving on it; one vehicle's dashboard is visible in the bottom left corner of the image.\n\nTo the right of the road, there are various elements typically found in an urban environment: trees lining the sidewalk, a pedestrian walking path on the far right, and some traffic signs or signals. In the background, you can see downtown buildings and a clear sky above them.\n\nOverlaying the image is a digital watermark that reads \"YOUR CUSTOM VIDEO EVIDENCE START HERE\" along with an address: \"1234 NORTH STREET.\" This text suggests that the image has been digitally altered or edited to include this message. The overall style of the image appears to be from a dashcam or surveillance camera mounted in a vehicle, given the angle and framing of the shot.
