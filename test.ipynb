Light exposure on the Eiffel tower suggests more time is spent towards evening, rather than morning.

The air is somewhat hazy and the sky is busy with heavy cloud cover. Large white and tan buildings and trees. The photo looks like it was taken during early morning, not early dawn or dusk. A large, beautiful white-looking structure in the center of the roundabout sits proudly with its large top and two pillars. From what I can see of the surrounding sky, the sun is rising in the photo. I would assume this is like to be a busy city in a northern hemisphere country with likely a temperate climate, where the temperature and the seasons are not too drastic. I imagine a city like Rome with similar architecture. These kinds of features are more typical in places like France or Italy, etc.\n",
